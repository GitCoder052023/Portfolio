    description: "I'm a backend-first developer focused on building reliable, scalable software systems from the ground up. With over six years of experience, I specialize in turning ambiguous problems into well-structured solutions that are easy to maintain, extend, and operate in real-world environments.",
    detailedDescription: [
        "I work comfortably across the entire development lifecycle, with a strong emphasis on backend architecture and system design. My approach prioritizes clean abstractions, secure and well-defined interfaces, and thoughtful trade-offs that support long-term scalability rather than short-term fixes.",
        "Alongside product work, I actively contribute to open-source projects, helping design and maintain production-ready tools and architectures that enable developers to ship higher-quality applications with confidence."
